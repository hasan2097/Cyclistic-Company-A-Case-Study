The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must apporove recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.


Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and your manager, believes that rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets  all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would by a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tacttics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cylclistic historical bike trip to identify trends.

Moreno has assigned you one of the question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
